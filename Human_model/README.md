GC-corrected BAM files should be placed in bams/gc_corrected/, and the module data should be placed in modelData/. The results will be saved in results/.


# 2. run the pipeline
```bash
# 1. 10-kb CPM data construction and rbcDNA-enriched/-depleted value generation for the development cohort.
./script/step1.sh zheer

# zheer pipeline
# 2. Feature preprocessing, GAM-normalization, and feature selection.
## Hardware requirement: At least 48 cores and 96GB RAM
./script/batch_build.sh zheer

# 3. Feature reduction, model development, and integration.
./script/step3.sh zheer 
python ./script/step3_test.py "$TYPE" `pwd` internal_test 

# 4. Independent validation.
TYPE="zheer"

# 4.1. Feature data construction for each independent validation set.
./script/extend_feature_data.sh "$TYPE" ind_sd
./script/extend_feature_data.sh "$TYPE" ind_wz
./script/extend_feature_data.sh "$TYPE" clin

# 4.2. Model evaluation and performance assessment.
python ./script/step3_test.py "$TYPE" `pwd` ind_sd
python ./script/step3_test.py "$TYPE" `pwd` ind_wz
python ./script/step3_test.py "$TYPE" `pwd` clin
``` 

Feature selection results will be saved in results/2_FeatureSelection/, feature reduction results in results/3_FeatureReduction/, and classification results in results/4_Classification/.
